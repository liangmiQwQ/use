Personal using tools and settings

For your reference, also for the day I get the new computer.

## Quick Start

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home?from=agents), [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/download) and their CLI should be installed and login manually

2. Run the following script to setup other tools.

```bash
bash ./setup.sh
```

Enter the password when prompted.
